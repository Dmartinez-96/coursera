The contents of the requested header files will be temporarily copied into the cpp source code file where they are included. Then, the cpp file with all of its extra included content will be compiled into something called an object file. (Our provided examples keep the object files hidden in a subdirectory, so you don't need to bother with them. But, if you see a file that has a .o extension, that is an object file.) Each cpp file is separately compiled into an object file. So, in this case Cube.cpp will be compiled into Cube.o, and main.cpp will be compiled into main.o.\n",

The compiled object files are allowed to rely on definitions that appear in the other object files. That's why it's okay that main.cpp doesn't have the Cube function definitions included: as long as main.cpp does know about the type information from the Cube function signatures in Cube.h, the main.o file will be \"linked against\" the compiled definitions in the Cube.o file. (I don't know why we say \"link against\" instead of \"link with\" when we talk about this, but that is the usual terminology!) The linker program will also link against system-wide object files, such as for iostream. After the compiler and linker programs finish processing your code, you will get an executable file as a result. In this case, that file is simply named main."

For example, if you try to add together a floating point double value and an integer int value, the int will be converted to double first, and then the result of the addition will have type double as well. But if you save a double value to an int variable, the floating point value will be truncated to an integer! For example:\n",

        "After viewing the lecture about stack memory, you should be already have an intuitive idea about how block scope works. The idea is that certain blocks of code, signified by { }, create an inner stack on top of the previous stack, which can hide the pre-existing values. The lifetime of stack variables inside a block is called the variable's scope. Variables created on the stack inside the inner block are only in existence for the duration of the block. When the block ends, the inner stack is removed, and the pre-existing values in the outer scope are available again (because they are still in scope!).\n",

This is actually better than causing a silent security vulnerabilty or another problem that is harder to detect!

Instead, unsigned integers have an increased upper positive value range compared to signed integers of the same memory usage. (Signed integers devote a bit of memory just to be able to represent a negative sign.) Unsigned integers are sometimes used in special cases to make use of memory extremely efficiently; for example, a data storage format might use them in order to be more compact. But mixing unsigned and signed integers in your code can cause unexpected problems. Let's walk through a few examples with unsigned integers.\n",

        "Unsigned ints can't represent negative values. Instead, they sacrifice the ability to represent negative numbers in exchange for a higher upper positive limit to the value range that they can represent, using the same number of bits as the comparable signed integer. However, the underlying bit representation that unsigned integers use for these very large values is actually the same as the representation that signed integers use for their negative value range. This means that a negative signed int may be re-interpreted as a very large positive unsigned int, and vice versa. This can cause strange behavior if you mix signed and unsigned ints. If you do arithmetic between signed and unsigned ints, then you can get undesired results if negative values should logically have arisen.\n",

However, you do need to be careful if you are approaching the upper limit for a signed int even if you are using unsigned ints. Signed ints have a lower maximum value, so if you get an unsigned int greater than that limit and then cast it to signed int, it will be interpreted as a negative number you did not expect.\n",

If x is 10 and y is 20, obviously `y-x` will return a valid value, but `x-y=-10`, which is not representable accurately by an unsigned int, which will instead give a very large positive number.\n",

For example, if you are assigning an unsigned int value to a signed int, you can check whether the signed int shows a negative value.

So, on the first loop iteration, \"0 <= (a very large positive integer)\" will be evaluated as true, and the loop body will execute, evaluating v[0], even though there is no first item in v to access.
